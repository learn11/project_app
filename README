to easy run my app you can you the docker compose 
go in the comandline to this directory (after cloning) and run commands 'docker compose build' 'docker compose up'
then it will build 3 conteiners (sql,react,python)

you can see the up on localhost:3000
and the backed will run on localhost:8000

*you need docker*
